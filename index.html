				<h2>Dataset</h2>
	
				<p>
					The dataset I worked with highlights corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates in different Boston neighborhoods over a 20 year time period (2004 to 2024). The data comes from property assessment records. Additionally, this dataset shows different demographic data  and housing data (including number of vacant units and occupied units). From the metadata corporate ownership is defined by identifying corporations “with markers such as “LLC”...“Corp”, “Realty”..."Bank"...”. There is a note in the metadata that some corporate-owned properties may not be classified as such or other properties may be misclassified. Owner occupancy rates are defined as the rates of properties that are occupied by property owners. The data can be accessed with permission from 11.C85 professors and the Warren Group.

				<h3>Dataset Quality</h3>
	
				<p>Initially when assessing the data I found some issues such as: 
					</p>

						<figcaption>
						The fields for Back Bay and Mission Hill Neighborhoods had null values for different demographic metrics as noted in this map of different neighborhoods in Boston and Asian Pacific Islander population. Although it might not have been noticed at first a closer look at the data and map showed these issues. I removed those neighborhoods from my analysis for more accurate visualizations.

							Additionally, I found that there was missing data (both demographic and for unit type) for the Fenway, North End, and West End Neighborhoods. This can be seen in the table of neighborhood and unit metrics below. I also removed these neighborhoods from my analysis for clearer visualizations.

							Much of the data was not actualized by year, and therefore was the same over the 20 year period. For example, the data for racial group populations was the same every year because the census does not report by neighborhood but instead by census block group. Additionally, the data for occupied units and vacant units was also the same over time. The only data that was different over time was owner occupied rate and vacancy rate.  Therefore, much of the analysis I did was limited to specific years or did not involve a time component, limiting my analysis a bit. This can be seen in the visualization below that looks at different minority populations over time in Allston.

							Finally, when looking at the data joins between zip codes and neighborhoods, specifically in the spatial data, they don’t seem accurate. I had a difficult time figuring out the best practice on 1) how to ensure that the zipcodes were encoding for the right neighborhoods, and 2) merging zip codes so a new geography was made to create the boundary of the neighborhoods. I continued to have this issue and I am interested in learning work-arounds for this problem. You can see some of these spatial issues highlighted in the map below which shows a geography clearly not in downtown Boston being encoded as Downtown.

					<p>Overall, to make the data easier to work with I also made sure to remove any nulls to ensure that these data points did not come out in my visualizations.

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> What neighborhoods in Boston face the most speculation?</li>
				<p> I am interested in answering this question because I am cognizant of the impacts evictions have on neighborhoods, such as gentrification and speculation. After reading the articles on eviction, I suspect that speculation would occur in neighborhoods of color, but am interested to see which neighborhoods specifically are most impacted. </p>
				<li>What minority groups are most affected by speculation in Boston?
				</li>
				<p>Similarly to question one, since we are focused on corporate ownership and absentee owners I am interested in which racial groups are impacted by speculation. I believe that it is likely not a fair distribution of speculation around the city and is likely centered in Black and Brown communities as mentioned in the article by Huntley Et. al. Answering this question might provide insight to which neighborhoods could benefit from policies that limit speculation in the future and provide assistance to these communities. 
				</p>
				<li>How has corporate ownership changed in each Boston neighborhood overtime?</li>
				<p>I was interested in this question because according to the article (Huntley Et. al) there were more evictions during COVID, and I am interested if corporate ownership in Boston went up after 2020. Having temporal data allows us to see interesting trends that can highlight injustices in our communities. 
				</p>
				<li>How has owner occupancy changed in each Boston neighborhood overtime?</li>
				<p> I am curious how owner occupancy has changed as well in the area to see if similarly to corporate ownership increasing over time, perhaps private ownership has increased. This could be an indication of gentrification and displacement of minority populations.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>There were several limitations in the data that prevented me from doing a more thorough analysis, such as not having data that was collected every year (data was the same every year for several measures). Only having corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates be responsive to the year made it more difficult to show relationships with other variables over time. Additionally there was data that would have been very helpful to supplement and bolster my analysis such as income data, rental rates, and more elaborate housing data. Another limitation was just my technical skills when it came to doing specific tasks primarily around merging and joining spatial data in Tableau. 
			</p>
			<p>
				However, from my analysis I was able to identify a few patterns or highlights. Neighborhoods like South Boston Waterfront and Downtown have seen the most changes in corporate ownership and have the highest corporate ownership today–this is likely due to new construction and investment in these neighborhoods. To show this, it would be great to have accurate property data that showed total units over time which if there was new construction or speculation. Additionally, these neighborhoods have high White populations which I am curious if is a historic trend. It would be interesting to see data on property values by neighborhood and median income in these neighborhoods over time to understand economic and social changes to the neighborhood. With further analysis, it is likely neighborhoods with a high racial minority population which are being most impacted by speculation and evictions. We see this through the maps of race by neighborhood, the bar chart of owner occupancy and vacancy by neighborhood, and the color-coded table which both highlight Roxbury and Dorchester as potential hotspots. With high levels of vacant units it is likely that the owner occupancy rate is due to private buyers that are buying the properties as an asset, and are not living in the property fulltime, likely displacing families who need housing. Additional analysis may be needed to come to an effective conclusion, however, this data tracks with the readings which provide evidence of higher evictions and speculation across minority neighborhoods in Massachusetts.
